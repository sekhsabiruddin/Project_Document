Initially, I possessed no prior knowledge pertaining to the Gatsby framework. In order to acquire proficiency in this technology, I engaged in a structured learning process facilitated through online tutorials. Specifically, I availed myself of educational content available on the YouTube channel managed by Net Ninja.With the exception of challenges encountered while working with the Gatsby framework, I successfully executed the implementation of all other aspects of the project seamlessly.
